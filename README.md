[CI source integrity and dependency updates](docs/engineering/CI_SOURCE_INTEGRITY.md)


Open-source local-first web application under [Apache-2.0](LICENSE). **Current implementation: web workspace and supervised Go runtime; complete domain workflow pending.**

## Clone and run the current workspace

Prerequisites: Linux amd64, Git, Node 24.19.0, npm CLI 11.9.0, installed Go (1.21+ for toolchain selection) and rootless Podman 4.9.3. Setup selects Go 1.27.2; use the pinned npm CLI shown in the clone guide.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Parsa-Emami/Miragemesh.git
cd Miragemesh
npm run setup
npm start
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:4173. Current features are a roadmap browser and local bounded JSON structure preview. No Python, database, paid/cloud account, public domain or sibling clone is needed for this shell. The local Go runtime exposes health/version only; domain processing remains unavailable. [Clone guide](docs/engineering/CLONE_TO_RUN.md).

## Full product endpoint

Enroll sensor -> apply signed config -> isolated decoy event -> disconnect -> spool -> reconnect with duplicate ACK test -> triage and retention gap check.

[C30](plans/commits/C30.md) proves the first locally usable supported product from a clean clone, including restart/restore. [C40](plans/commits/C40.md) proves complete published OSS v1. These are future evidence gates, not current shell capability claims. [Runtime resources](ops/runtime-requirements.json).

## Implement the next commit

```sh
npm run plan -- status
npm run plan -- next
npm run plan -- show C07
npm run check
```

Each [work card](plans/COMMIT_ROADMAP.md) specifies paths, actions, resources, fixtures, acceptance, negative tests, command availability and rollback. [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and [execution contract](docs/agents/EXECUTION_CONTRACT.md) let an agent resume from this repository alone. [فارسی](docs/ROADMAP_FA.md).
